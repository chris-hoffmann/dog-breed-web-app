# What breed is that dog?
Our deep learning-based image classifier can help answering this question.

This repository documents a small class project that aimed at building an image classifier for identifying dog breeds. We went one step further by creating a simple web app around the classifier and then deployed the app to Heroku.
If you want to check it out visit the app at

  <a href="https://dog-breed-web-app.herokuapp.com"><strong>dog-breed-web-app.herokuapp.com</strong></a>
</p>
  
It is really simple to use: just upload a portrait image of a dog and make a prediction. 

Please be aware that it takes a bit until the result of the prediction is displayed. The app will also tell you if it fails to detect a dog in the uploaded image.
